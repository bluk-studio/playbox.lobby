### Overview

This repository contains source code for playbox's lobby instance. It's build on top of [Minestom](https://minestom.net/) and has:

- Authorization using [api.playbox.network](https://api.playbox.network) 
- Programmatic resource-pack builder and server *(serves resource-packs under https://resourcepacks.playbox.network/lobby domain)*
- Helm chart for effortless continuous deployment
- Continuous image building and production deployment pipelines using [drone](https://www.drone.io/)

### Plans

Currently, we are working on [omnidoc](https://git.odzi.dog/omnidoc/web) *(self-hosted notion alternative)* to speed up our development pipelines and communication between team members. All our future plans and roadmaps will be hosted on [docs.odzi.dog](https://docs.odzi.dog)

### Contributions

We are developing this project with community in mind, so there will be numerous ways for our community members to contribute to this project. But for now, there are *zero* ways to do this.
